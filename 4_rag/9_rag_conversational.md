## Pipeline Explanation for User Query

### 1. **User Input**:

- The user enters a query (the latest question).

### 2. **Contextualizing the Question**:

- The `contextualize_q_prompt` is used to reformulate the user's query so it can be understood as a standalone question without relying on previous conversation history.
- The `contextualize_q_system_prompt` is responsible for guiding the model to rephrase the question if necessary, using the chat history and latest user input.

### 3. **History-Aware Retriever**:

- The `history_aware_retriever` uses the reformulated standalone question. It retrieves relevant context from an existing knowledge base or document store based on the reformulated question. This ensures that the system can answer the question with all relevant past and present information.

### 4. **Question-Answering (QA) System**:

- The `qa_prompt` is responsible for formatting the response generation. The retrieved context is passed to the QA system (which is an instance of an LLM in the code).
- The system uses the `qa_system_prompt` to answer the user's question in a concise way (3 sentences max). It relies on the `context` retrieved in the previous step to ensure that the answer is accurate and relevant.

### 5. **Chain Execution**:

- The query then passes through the constructed chain: first through the `history_aware_retriever` and then through the `question_answer_chain`.
- The final output is generated by combining retrieval and answer generation, which is done by the `rag_chain` (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

### 6. **Final Response**:

- The system provides the user with an answer based on the retrieved context and the question reformulated (if necessary), ensuring it is concise and well-informed by the prior history and relevant documents.

### **Summary of the Flow**:

1. **User Query** →
2. **Reformulate Question (if needed)** →
3. **Retrieve Relevant Context** →
4. **Answer Question Using Retrieved Context** →
5. **Return Answer to User**.

This ensures that even if the user's query is dependent on past conversations or external context, the system retrieves the necessary information and generates a well-informed and concise answer.
